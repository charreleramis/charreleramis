<h1>Hi there! 👋 I'm Charrel</h1>

I'm a full-stack developer based in the Philippines.

I build web and mobile applications from scratch — turning ideas into functional products. I often design and refine solutions in my mind before writing the first line of code, then ship them efficiently.

### Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages & Frameworks**: TypeScript, Python, JavaScript  
- **Frontend**: React, React Native  
- **Backend**: Node.js (MERN stack)  
- **Favorite Tools**: Xcode, Figma, MacBook  

Check out my pinned repositories — my personal favorite is **[spacemaster-app](https://github.com/yourusername/spacemaster-app)**.

### Fun Facts
- I also study law  
- Fishing is one of my favorite hobbies  
- I enjoy reading books in my free time  

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore my projects or reach out. 🚀
